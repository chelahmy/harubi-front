# Harubi Front
A javascript view framework for Harubi, which complete the MVC framework. Harubi is a PHP MVC framework minus the view.
It is a higher-level separation of concerns between client and server. The main idea is to remove the view burden
from the server. Harubi was designed purposely without the view concern. Harubi Front makes it complete.

Harubi Front comes with a complete user-based application with access control by roles. It also has basic user groups.
The application can be extended. Or, totally new applications can be created using the framework. The application is
an example. There are various reusable components in the application such as table listing and sorting, searching and
filtering, and client-side access control.

The framework is page-based. Every page is based on a pair of a html and a javascript files. A breadcrumb can be set
to navigate from page to page. Communication with a Harubi server is asynchronous. Hence, a page must be ready with
placeholders to accept the asynchronous data from the server.

Please read the page source codes from the application to get a better idea.
